In the previous post, [KDE Connect iOS Develop Dairy(1) Build](/2020/04/18/KDEConnect-iOS-dev-dairy-1/), the build of KDE Connect iOS has been fixed, the application can be installed into a device or a simulator.

To connect with the other devices, we need to pair with them. But, before that, the devices need discover each other with the KDE Connect identity mechanism.

# Identity Process

The initial identity process is really simple, as shown below:

{% asset_img KDEConnectIdentityWithoutSSL.png Identity Process without TLS/SSL %}

1. First, a device A will send a UDP broadcast packet, which carries its identity packet;
2. Each device B, which receives the UDP broadcast, will try to extract the TCP port information in the packet, and try to connect with the device via the port;
3. With a TCP connection, each device B will send its own identity packet to the device A;
4. Then the devices will add a link item to the discovered device list, and wait the users' actions.

# Update Identity Packet

With a first attemp, all my devices can find each other, except the iOS one.

In the debug mode, I saw discover message and an output associated:

```
"Inoki" uses an old protocol version, this won't work
```

So, I captured the packets using Wireshark, to see why the old implementation in KDE Connect iOS doesn't work. The differences are in the packet content and the tailor data.

## Identity Packet content

All network packets are generated by serilizing `NetWorkPackage` class, which is defined in `lib/NetworkPackage.h` and `lib/NetworkPackage.m`.

The properties of that class are:

```objective-c
@property(nonatomic) NSString* _Id;
@property(nonatomic) NSString *_Type;
@property(nonatomic) NSMutableDictionary *_Body;
@property(nonatomic) NSData *_Payload;
@property(nonatomic) NSDictionary *_PayloadTransferInfo;
@property(nonatomic)long _PayloadSize;
```

After the serilization, the content will be a JSON format string. For example, the packet content from KDE Connect iOS is:

```json
{
    "id":"1587284674",
    "type":"kdeconnect.identity",
    "body":{
        "deviceId":"test-kdeconnect-ios",
        "SupportedOutgoingInterfaces":"kdeconnect.ping,kdeconnect.mpris,kdeconnect.share,kdeconnect.clipboard,kdeconnect.mousepad,kdeconnect.battery,kdeconnect.calendar,kdeconnect.reminder,kdeconnect.contact",
        "protocolVersion":5,
        "tcpPort":1714,
        "deviceType":"Phone",
        "deviceName":"Inoki",
        "SupportedIncomingInterfaces":"kdeconnect.calendar,kdeconnect.clipboard,kdeconnect.ping,kdeconnect.reminder,kdeconnect.share,kdeconnect.contact"
    }
}
```

And the one from KDE Connect on the other platforme is:

```json
{
    "id":1587284383,
    "type":"kdeconnect.identity",
    "body":{
        "deviceId":"9985DA4FDD3449C78ACC8597D2C5A782",
        "protocolVersion":7,
        "tcpPort":1716,
        "deviceType":"phone",
        "deviceName":"Inoki",
        "incomingCapabilities":[
            "kdeconnect.calendar","kdeconnect.clipboard","kdeconnect.ping","kdeconnect.reminder","kdeconnect.share","kdeconnect.contact"
        ],
        "outgoingCapabilities":[
            "kdeconnect.ping","kdeconnect.mpris","kdeconnect.share","kdeconnect.clipboard","kdeconnect.mousepad","kdeconnect.battery","kdeconnect.calendar","kdeconnect.reminder","kdeconnect.contact"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Fix id field type

We can see the first difference is about the `id` field. In the KDE Connect iOS packet, it's a string. But in the newer version protocol, it's an integer.

So, I change its property type from `NSString` to `NSNumber`:
```objective-c
@property(nonatomic) NSNumber *_Id;
@property(nonatomic) NSString *_Type;
@property(nonatomic) NSMutableDictionary *_Body;
@property(nonatomic) NSData *_Payload;
@property(nonatomic) NSDictionary *_PayloadTransferInfo;
@property(nonatomic)long _PayloadSize;
```

### Update capabilities type

Another big change is the type and the name of description of capacibilities:
- They were `SupportedOutgoingInterfaces` and `SupportedIncomingInterfaces`, with string type;
- In the latest version, they are `incomingCapabilities` and `outgoingCapabilities`, with array type.

In KDE Connect iOS, it's generated by the following lines in `lib/NetworkPackage.m`:

```objective-c
[np setObject:[[[PluginFactory sharedInstance] getSupportedIncomingInterfaces] componentsJoinedByString:@","] forKey:@"SupportedIncomingInterfaces"];
[np setObject:[[[PluginFactory sharedInstance] getSupportedOutgoingInterfaces] componentsJoinedByString:@"," ] forKey:@"SupportedOutgoingInterfaces"];
```

Obviously, the returned values are arrays, but they are joined by a comma string.

So, I just change the key string, and remove the `componentsJoinedByString` method:

```objective-c
[np setObject:[[PluginFactory sharedInstance] getSupportedIncomingInterfaces] forKey:@"incomingCapabilities"];
[np setObject:[[PluginFactory sharedInstance] getSupportedOutgoingInterfaces] forKey:@"outgoingCapabilities"];
```

### Update the protocol version

The protocol version field is defined in the header file:

```objective-c
#define ProtocolVersion         5
```

I update it to `7` to match the current version.

## Identity Packet tailor data

The tailor data of identity packet from KDE Connect iOS in a Wireshark traffic is `\x0D\x0A`.

And the one from other KDE Connect versions are `\x0A`.

So, I change the line in `lib/NetworkPackage.m`:

```git
- #define LFDATA [NSData dataWithBytes:"\x0D\x0A" length:2]
+ #define LFDATA [NSData dataWithBytes:"\x0A" length:1]
```

# Conclusion

Finally, the KDE Connect iOS can find the other device and establish the connections to them:

{% asset_img discovery.png Discovery %}

On the contrary, the others cannot find KDE Connect iOS client out yet. That's because the new version requires TLS/SSL after a TCP connnection. This will get fixed in the next post.

Good luck to myself!
